Automation often works best as an integrated, Multidiscipline effort that coordinates many separate departments and groups. Automation includes every branch Computer, Electronics, Mech /Auto.
In the fourth industrial revolution, the emphasis is on how machines and humans work together where repetitive and dangerous tasks can be relegated to machines and automated systems whereas humans can focus on aspects that require creativity, social skills, and emotional intelligence. This augmented collaborative workforce is the wave of the future and has enormous implications for employment in the automation age.More and more businesses are moving towards digitization.
According to McKinsey, Process Automation can bring about a quick and robust ROI, i.e., up to 200% in the first year of deployment, and 20‚Äì25% cost savings.
But the benefits go beyond the financial ones; consider rapid scalability to demand spikes, headcount flexibility, improved risk, compliance.
Automation can help immensely in agile methodologies for  product development (DevOps!)
The development and deployment of humanitarian robotics and automation technologies can be thought of as a bottom-up approach that is cost-effective and geared towards improving the quality of lives.
Objective:
ÔÅ∂	To address gap between Industry and academia
ÔÅ∂	Increasing efficiency and quality while reducing costs using innovative tools and techniques.
ÔÅ∂	Helping to understand the system with live projects.

ÔÅ∂	Create a shared understanding, about the capabilities and the potential added value and the governance
ÔÅ∂	Establish ongoing alignment mechanisms between industry and academics.

ÔÅ∂	Create awareness of the technology and the tools through live projects

ÔÅ∂	Establish sponsorship for final year students and promote start-ups.

ÔÅ∂	Proof the added value of the technology by showing the Proof-of-Concept demo.

NIRMAN is a youth leadership development initiative conceived by Padma Shri Dr. Abhay Bang and Dr.Rani Bang to facilitate the Search for Purpose among Indian Youth and nurture them as Social Contributors. NIRMAN sensitizes young minds to different burning social challenges and equips them for effective action while simultaneously investing in youth‚Äôs own flourishing.
 

Since its inception, more than 2000 participants have been through the NIRMAN process so far from all the 36 districts of Maharashtra and 20 other states in India. Medical and engineering students make up two thirds of the total participants, and the rest are from diverse backgrounds like law, management, chartered accountancy, agriculture, journalism, film making, fine arts, and the sciences including physics, maths, statistics, biology, etc.

 

The age group for participation in the program is 18 ‚Äì 28 years.

 

The selection process for the next batch of NIRMAN has now started and we are inviting applications for the same till 31st August.



The selected cohort of ~150 will be taken through a series of three residential training workshops of a week each, spread across the next one and half year (without clashing with academics/exams).

 

I am hereby sharing the material related to the selection process of NIRMAN.
Filling up the application form itself will make the participants think about various important questions in their lives as well as the world around them.
 
It would be great if this information and email can be circulated widely among the students of various departments of your institute who will immensely benefit from this introspective experience!

As NEP 2020 emphasizes the need for holistic education and students' development, participating in NIRMAN will be a great step in that direction, for the students and the institute. 

Thanks for your support!!

Warm Regards,

This is in reference with the mail sent you earlier regarding registration of all the University students under Academic Bank of Credits. As we all know, the University has registered for Academic Bank of Credits. Please go through the attachments and bring it to the notice of all the students through presentations and notices of the departments. 

Ask  the students to register on the ABC portal as early as possible and avail the benefit of this facility. Also submit the information about students registered with the ABC.
 
Almost all the students department of E & TC has done the registration. In case of any difficulty please contact.
9/6/22, 15:23 - S. R Hivre Mam: Dear Students,

Please refer to this office letter of even No. dated 06th May 2022 (copy enclosed) on the above subject. As communicated vide aforesaid letter ‚ÄòAcademic Bank of Credits (ABC)‚Äô, is an initiative of the Ministry of Education aiming to provide academic flexibility, multi-disciplinary, and holistic education by removing the rigid curricular boundaries and creating new possibilities for lifelong learning. ABC's distributed & flexible teaching-learning enables students to learn at their own pace, stop in the middle of a course, and take it up again whenever it is convenient for them. 

2. The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is an educational digital platform built by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)'s National e-Governance Division (NeGD) in line with the National Academic Depository (NAD) to facilitate students‚Äô seamless mobility between or within degree-granting Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal system of credit recognition, credit accumulation, credit transfers, and credit redemption. Students can register for a unique ABC ID, access an interactive dashboard to track their credit accumulation, and initiate a choice-based credit transfer process via the ABC platform. For academic institutions, the ABC systems provide a dashboard to accept, reject or begin credit transfer requests for students based on course curriculum, as well as search student data, and direct/give feedback/reasons for approval or rejection reasons for credit transfer requests. 

3.  It is requested to register with the Academic Bank of Credits at www.abc.gov.in. A detailed User Manual with step-by-step instructions and screenshots is provided in the ABC portal's Resources area under the General Resources category for both academic institutions and students.

4.  It is also advised to start accepting documents from DigiLocker for future admission processes which are treated at par with the original documents as per IT Act 2000. Copy of the letter from the Secretary, UGC is enclosed for ready reference. An awareness campaign may also be launched to educate students about the Academic Bank of Credits facility and encourage them for opening academic bank credits accounts.

5.  The team from NeGD will assist you with the onboarding and deployment of your services. For more information, you may contact Mr Durgarasad Dash, Additional Director (durga@digitalindia.gov.in, ph:011-30481649) or Mr Prasoon Kumar Sr. Manager, (prasoon.k@digitalindia.gov.in) of the NeGD.

6.  Ministry of Education is laying serious emphasis on the adoption of the Academic Bank of Credits by the HEIs and reviewing it periodically. In view of the foregoing, you are requested to adopt ABC as soon as possible but in any case not later than 15th July 2022.

Topic
Digital Payments: Is India ready for the next big leap
Description
Over the last eight years, the volume of digital payments in India has taken a giant leap rising from an annual volume of ‚Çπ316 crores in the financial year (FY) 2014-15 to ‚Çπ8,840 crores in FY2021-22.

As India races in the fast lane of building digital public infrastructure comprising Account Aggregator (AA), Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN), Open Network Digital Commerce (ONDC), and United Health Interface (UHI), what are the 0pportunities and threats that should be on the radar of the stakeholders of the digital payment ecosystem in the country?

Does the payment ecosystem have enough strategic insight, systemic integrity, and flexibility to lead the epic transformation as India navigates the significant change brought about by several digital public infrastructure investments that some may claim are too soon and too fast?

Is India's readiness for the digital payment ecosystem disconnected from reality, considering how quickly the government is pushing the development of digital public infrastructure?

I hope this message finds you well and ready for the Smart India Hackathon 2023 (SIH 2023). We greatly value your enthusiasm and commitment to this event, and we want to ensure that it aligns seamlessly with your institution's needs.

With that in mind, we are pleased to inform you important updates:

Extended Deadlines: We have extended the deadlines for SPOC Registration, Team Nomination, and Idea Submission to October 31, 2023. This extension provides you with additional time to prepare thoroughly for SIH 2023.

Optional Internal Hackathon: In response to your valuable feedback, we are making the Internal Hackathon optional. Teams are no longer required to participate in the Internal Hackathon before team nomination. This change offers your institution more flexibility in its preparations for SIH 2023.

**Institute can nominate maximum upto 100 teams per institute (90 shortlist + 10 waitlist) Hurry up!** One team can nominate multiple ideas against multiple Problem Statements (PS) 

ISRO Problem Statement: We are excited to share that the problem statement for ISRO is now live. You can access it through the following link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xkJrlysFlzqb7l65tzzHVLixjbSmcgK6/view?usp=sharing]. This provides your institution with an excellent opportunity to explore and work on ISRO challenges as part of SIH 2023.

Additionally, a dedicated webpage on the SIH 2023 website will showcase the efforts of participating institutions, whether or not they choose to participate in the Internal Hackathon. This platform provides an excellent opportunity to exhibit your institution's skills, innovation, and dedication to the SIH community. We kindly request you to share these updates with your teams and participants at your earliest convenience.  

The grand finale of SIH 2023 will be organized in the month of December 2023 (tentative) dates will be announced soon.

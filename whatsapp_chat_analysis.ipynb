As communicated vide aforesaid letter ‚ÄòAcademic Bank of Credits (ABC)‚Äô, is an initiative of the Ministry of Education aiming to provide academic flexibility, multi-disciplinary, and holistic education by removing the rigid curricular boundaries and creating new possibilities for lifelong learning. ABC's distributed & flexible teaching-learning enables students to learn at their own pace, stop in the middle of a course, and take it up again whenever it is convenient for them. \\n\\n2. The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is an educational digital platform built by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)'s National e-Governance Division (NeGD) in line with the National Academic Depository (NAD) to facilitate students‚Äô seamless mobility between or within degree-granting Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal system of credit recognition, credit accumulation, credit transfers, and credit redemption. Students can register for a unique ABC ID, access an interactive dashboard to track their credit accumulation, and initiate a choice-based credit transfer process via the ABC platform. For academic institutions, the ABC systems provide a dashboard to accept, reject or begin credit transfer requests for students based on course curriculum, as well as search student data, and direct/give feedback/reasons for approval or rejection reasons for credit transfer requests. \\n\\n3.  It is requested to register with the Academic Bank of Credits at www.abc.gov.in. A detailed User Manual with step-by-step instructions and screenshots is provided in the ABC portal's Resources area under the General Resources category for both academic institutions and students.\\n\\n4.  It is also advised to start accepting documents from DigiLocker for future admission processes which are treated at par with the original documents as per IT Act 2000. Copy of the letter from the Secretary, UGC is enclosed for ready reference. An awareness campaign may also be launched to educate students about the Academic Bank of Credits facility and encourage them for opening academic bank credits accounts.\\n\\n5.
